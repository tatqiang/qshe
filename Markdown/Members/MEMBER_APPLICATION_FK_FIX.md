# 🔧 Fix: Database Query Errors - RESOLVED ✅

## ❌ Problems Encountered

### Error 1: Missing Foreign Key (FIXED)
```
Error: "Could not find a relationship between 'member_application_tokens' and 'projects'"
```
**Cause:** Missing FK constraint  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (schema files already updated)

### Error 2: Column Doesn't Exist (FIXED)
```
Error: "column projects_1.name_th does not exist"
```
**Cause:** Projects table only has `name` (English), not `name_th` (Thai)  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (code updated to only select `name`)

---

## ✅ All Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Schema Files Updated
The schema files now include proper foreign key constraints:
- ✅ `schema_member_application_tokens` - Added `project_id` FK
- ✅ `schema_member_applications` - Added `project_id` FK

### Fix 2: Code Updated
The TypeScript code now queries only existing columns:
- ✅ `MemberApplicationTokensPage.tsx` - Changed `projects (name, name_th)` → `projects (name)`

---

## 🚀 Action Required

**Just refresh your browser!**
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (hard refresh)
2. Navigate to `/admin/member-tokens`
3. Errors should be gone ✅

**No database changes needed** - the foreign keys already exist in your database from the schema files.

## 📊 Current Database Structure

```
projects table:
  ✅ id (UUID)
  ✅ name (VARCHAR) - English only
  ❌ name_th - Does NOT exist

companies table:
  ✅ id (UUID)
  ✅ name (VARCHAR) - English
  ✅ name_th (VARCHAR) - Thai

member_application_tokens table:
  ✅ project_id (UUID) → FK to projects(id)
  ✅ company_id (UUID) → FK to companies(id)
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

After refresh:
- ✅ Token page loads successfully
- ✅ Can create tokens
- ✅ Project names show in English
- ✅ Company names show in Thai (preferred) or English (fallback)

## � Summary

**What was wrong:**
1. Code tried to select `projects.name_th` (doesn't exist)
2. Foreign key constraints were missing from schema

**What was fixed:**
1. ✅ Updated schema files with FK constraints
2. ✅ Changed code to only select `projects.name`
3. ✅ No database migration needed (FKs already exist)

**Files modified:**
- `database/schema/schema_member_application_tokens`
- `database/schema/schema_member_applications`
- `src/pages/admin/MemberApplicationTokensPage.tsx`
