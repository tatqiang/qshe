# Backend Cleanup Summary

## What was moved to backend_backup/
- `server.js` - Express.js server with Supabase connection
- `server_old.js` - Previous version of server
- `api/` directory - API endpoints (auth/register.js)
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` - Node.js dependencies

## Why these files were removed
We switched from a backend server approach to a **frontend-only architecture** using direct Supabase client connections. This provides:

✅ **Simpler Architecture**: No backend server to maintain  
✅ **Better Performance**: Direct client-to-Supabase connection  
✅ **Easier Deployment**: Frontend-only deployment to Netlify/Vercel  
✅ **Azure AD Integration**: MSAL.js handles authentication directly in browser  

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Authentication**: Azure AD (MSAL.js) + Supabase users table
- **Database**: Direct Supabase client connection
- **Registration**: RegistrationModal component with useUserRegistration hook

## Files kept in backend/
- `.env` - Still contains Supabase credentials for reference
- `node_modules/` - Can be deleted if no longer needed

## Next Steps
1. Database schema has been updated with the SQL scripts
2. Registration flow is ready for testing
3. Project management uses the clean 7-field structure
