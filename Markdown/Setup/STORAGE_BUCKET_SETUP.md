# 📁 Safety Audit Photos - Storage Setup

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: No New Bucket Needed!

You already have the **`qshe`** bucket with folders:
- `patrols/` - For patrol photos
- `profiles/` - For profile photos  
- **`safety-audit-photos/`** - ← We'll add this folder (automatic!)

---

## 🎉 How It Works

The code has been updated to use your existing `qshe` bucket:

```typescript
// OLD (was looking for separate bucket):
.from('safety-audit-photos')

// NEW (uses existing bucket with folder):
.from('qshe')
.upload('safety-audit-photos/{auditId}/{timestamp}.jpg', file)
```

---

## � Folder Structure (After Upload)

```
qshe/  (existing bucket)
├── patrols/  (existing)
├── profiles/ (existing)
└── safety-audit-photos/  (← will be created automatically)
    └── a7d56841-d236-489d-92b8-d69133d57b44/  (audit ID)
        ├── 1760677234589.jpg
        ├── 1760677237814.jpg
        └── ...
```

## ✅ What You Need to Do

**NOTHING!** 🎉

The folder `safety-audit-photos/` will be **created automatically** when you upload the first photo. Supabase Storage creates folders on-demand.

---

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. Go to your Safety Audit form
2. Add photos to any category
3. Click "Create Audit" or "Update Audit"
4. ✅ Console should show: **"✅ Uploaded X photos"**
5. Check Supabase Storage → **`qshe`** bucket
6. You'll see new **`safety-audit-photos/`** folder!

---

## � Permissions

Your existing `qshe` bucket should already have the correct permissions:
- ✅ **Public** bucket (photos are viewable)
- ✅ **Authenticated** users can upload
- ✅ **Authenticated** users can delete

If you need to check permissions:
1. Go to Supabase → Storage → `qshe` bucket
2. Click **Policies** tab
3. Verify policies exist for INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE

**The photo upload is ready to use immediately!** 📸✅
