# 🎯 QUICK GUIDE - Member-Companies Junction Table

## ⚡ What This Solves

**Problem:** Original design = 1 member → 1 company only

**Real World:** Workers/contractors work for MULTIPLE companies over time

**Solution:** `member_companies` junction table = 1 member → MANY companies ✅

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Scenario: Worker Registration

```
Step 1: Admin creates token for "Company A"
Step 2: Worker fills form using token
Step 3: Member record created with company_id = "Company A" (primary)
Step 4: AUTOMATIC TRIGGER creates member_companies record
        ↓
        member_companies: 
        - member_id + company_id = "Company A"
        - status = 'active'
        - start_date = today
```

### Future: Worker Joins Company B

```
Admin adds worker to "Company B" via Member Management:
        ↓
        member_companies: 
        - member_id + company_id = "Company B"
        - status = 'active'
        - start_date = '2025-02-01'
        
Result: Worker now linked to BOTH Company A and Company B
```

## 🗂️ Database Structure

```
member_applications
├── id (member ID)
├── company_id (PRIMARY company - from token)
└── form_data (all member details)
        ↓ one-to-many
member_companies (JUNCTION TABLE)
├── member_application_id
├── company_id (can have MULTIPLE records per member)
├── start_date
├── end_date
├── position
└── status (active/inactive/terminated)
        ↓ many-to-one
companies
├── id
├── name
└── name_th
```

## 🔧 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL
```cmd
type c:\pwa\qshe10\qshe\database\create_member_companies_table.sql
```
1. Copy output
2. Open Supabase → SQL Editor
3. Paste and click "Run"

### Step 2: Verify
```sql
-- Check table created
SELECT * FROM member_companies LIMIT 5;

-- Check view created
SELECT * FROM member_all_companies LIMIT 5;

-- Check trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE event_object_table = 'member_applications';
```

## ✅ What Gets Created

1. **Table:** `member_companies`
   - 12 columns
   - 6 indexes
   - 2 RLS policies
   - 1 trigger (updated_at)

2. **View:** `member_all_companies`
   - Shows all companies per member
   - Aggregates data
   - Easy querying

3. **Trigger:** `create_initial_member_company()`
   - Auto-runs when member created
   - Links member to primary company
   - No manual step needed!

4. **Schema File:** `schema_member_companies`
   - For future reference
   - Matches production

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Linking
When member submits form:
- Primary company stored in `member_applications.company_id`
- Trigger AUTOMATICALLY creates `member_companies` record
- Member linked to company from day 1

### ✅ Multiple Companies
Future member management can:
- Add member to new company
- Track start/end dates
- Set position at each company
- Change status (active/inactive)

### ✅ Work History
Track full employment history:
- Which companies member worked for
- When they started/ended
- What position they held
- Current vs past employment

### ✅ Flexible Queries
Use helper view:
```sql
-- Get all members with their companies
SELECT * FROM member_all_companies;

-- Find members working for multiple companies
SELECT * FROM member_all_companies 
WHERE active_company_count > 1;

-- Get Company A's members
SELECT * FROM member_all_companies 
WHERE primary_company_id = 'company-a-uuid'
   OR all_companies::TEXT LIKE '%company-a-uuid%';
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After running migration:

- [ ] Table `member_companies` exists
- [ ] View `member_all_companies` exists  
- [ ] Trigger `trigger_create_initial_member_company` exists
- [ ] Create test member → Check member_companies auto-created
- [ ] Verify RLS policies allow admin access
- [ ] Test adding member to second company (manual INSERT)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run Migration** (create_member_companies_table.sql)
2. **Run RLS Fix** (member_application_tokens_rls_fix.sql)
3. **Refresh Browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. **Test Token Creation**
5. **Submit Form** → Verify member_companies created
6. **Future:** Build Member Management UI
