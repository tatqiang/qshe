## 🐛 Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue: Text Too Small
**Symptom:** Text is hard to read at 400px
**Fix:** Increase base size (change `text-xs` to `text-sm`)

### Issue: Too Much Space
**Symptom:** Filter section takes up entire screen at 400px
**Fix:** Reduce spacing (change `space-y-4` to `space-y-3`)

### Issue: Too Little Space
**Symptom:** Everything feels cramped and hard to tap at 400px
**Fix:** Increase spacing (change `p-2` to `p-3`)

### Issue: Text Overflow
**Symptom:** Long text breaks layout or goes off screen
**Fix:** Add `truncate` class and `max-w-*` constraint

### Issue: Button Not Tappable
**Symptom:** Hard to click button on mobile
**Fix:** Ensure `min-h-[38px]` for touch target
